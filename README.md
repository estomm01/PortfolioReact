# React-Portfolio App

  

Personal portfolio page (https://portfolioreactmm.herokuapp.com/) built in React.

  

## Building Process

1. Installed [New React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) using Node JS.

2. Migrated my [VanillaJS Portfolio Version](https://github.com/kodi24fever/vanillajs-portfolio) and migrated it into a new React Application.

3.I decided to use [Wow.js](https://wowjs.uk/) and [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) libraries.

4. Used React Props to manage components references in the application and share components details to create [SmoothScroll](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/).

5. Most of the page uses Bootstrap, except for the modal gallery.

6. Created different modals for the gallery project and using [React Event Handlers](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html) I could show each project modal.

7. The form uses [formsfree.io](https://formspree.io/) for the backend submission.

8. I used images from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com) which are free to use and icons from [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) which are also free to use.

9. I wanted to create a eye catching animated background at the top of the page, so I used some help from [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/saransh/pen/BKJun) and adapted the code to my website.

## Challenges 

1. Implementing Wow.js + Animate.css was difficult at the beginning, but looks awesome

2. 2.Sharing DOM component details such as height, offsetTops, etc, between other components was a bit difficult because [React Refs](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html) had to match parent containers' ids. 

3. After using Bootstrap I am learning some CSS3 tricks like flex-box and how to use @keyframes + animation.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
